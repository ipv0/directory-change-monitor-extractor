#### Goal

Learning python, one of my first projects. As well as getting tired of manually extracting multipart RAR archives.


#### What it does

Automatically extracts multipart RAR archives, as certain things you may download online are packaged in that way.


#### Description

The script continuously monitors the given folder for new files. 
When a RAR (multipart or not) is saved to the folder (ex. by a torrent client), 
the script automatically unpacks it into a different directory on the background. 
Then it continues watching.


#### Why?

Because extracting multipart RARs for scene releases can become bothersome.  
This script will put all newly downloaded episodes in one folder, extracted ready to watch. 


#### Note:

It's been written awhile ago and hasn't been tested.
