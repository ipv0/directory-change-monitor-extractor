#### Goal

Learning python, one of my first projects. As well as getting tired of manually extracting multipart RAR archives.


#### What it does

Automatically extracts multipart RAR archives, as most scene releases on torrents and usenet are packaged in that way.


#### Description

The script continuously monitors the given folder for new files. When a RAR (multipart or not) is saved to the folder (ex. by a torrent client), the script automatically unpacks it into a different directory on the background. Then it continues watching.


#### Why?

Because extracting multipart RARs for scene releases (tv shows mostly) can become bothersome.  This script will put all newly downloaded episodes in one folder, extracted ready to watch. You are free to continue seeding the original RAR's.


#### Note:

It's been written awhile ago and hasn't been tested.
